# Implemented-a-naive-bayes-classifier-for-binary-classifier-for-detecting-spam
Aims to build a machine learning model that can effectively identify and classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). The project utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, an efficient probabilistic classification technique known for simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
NLTK package is also used for stop words in english. Removing the stop words is one of the crucial step for better efficiency as they are present in both spam and ham messages. 
The text processing of the given message involves the following steps : 
  - Convert all words to lower case
  - Tokenize the data
  - Remove single characters
  - Remove stopwords
  - Remove rare or non-meaningful words
  - Perform stemming

The steps were followed and the final model was successfully able to classify whether the given message is spam or not along with a confidence score. The efficiency of the model is given below:
