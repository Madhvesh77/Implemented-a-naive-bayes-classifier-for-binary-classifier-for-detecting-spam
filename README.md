# Implemented-a-naive-bayes-classifier-for-binary-classifier-for-detecting-spam
Aims to build a machine learning model that can effectively identify and classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). The project utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, an efficient probabilistic classification technique known for simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
